    <p style={{color:"black", textAlign:"justify"}}>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While HVAC systems are responsible for regulating the comfort levels of most indoor environments, a chiller plant act as a centralized cooling system which provides cooling for a building or a number of buildings. Additionally, it provides a portion of the air conditioning by HVAC systems. Although chiller plants sound like a new innovation, the concept is not actually new. Records have shown that the ancient Romans were already using cooling for their indoor environments. However, they did not use a centralized plant but instead used water to run through their buildingsâ€™ walls in order to cool down the temperature inside. </p>
